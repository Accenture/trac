Settings for IntelliJ IDEA can be shared by copying them from the project .idea
folder into the "idea" folder here. Developers can use the copy settings script
to update their IDEA config with these files.

This mechanism can be used to save IDEA module files for non-Gradle modules (e.g.
language runtimes or API bindings). SDK settings are workstation-specific so will
always need to be set up after the repository is cloned.
