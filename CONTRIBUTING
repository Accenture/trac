So you'd like to contribute to TRAC, that's fantastic! Our medium-term goal is
to open up development of the TRAC platform to a wider community of interested
parties. We still have a way to go to reach this goal.

The initial release of TRAC, version 0.1, is our first step in opening up the
platform. The code is released under the Apache license, version 2.0, so you
are free to examine the code and use it in accordance with that license. For
the time being a legal assessment will be required before we can accept any
contribution.
