/**
 * Public API for writing metadata objects into the TRAC metadata store.
 *
 * This API allows objects to be created directly, by supplying their metadata
 * definition and a set of tags. These definitions and tags are validated,
 * assigned an ID and version (in an object header) then saved as they are. Only
 * certain types of objects can be created / updated directly via the public API
 * (currently FLOW and CUSTOM objects). Other types of objects are created by TRAC
 * as a result of operations on the platform, for example a model import job will
 * create a model definition. To understand the TRAC metadata model, start by
 * reading the documentation for ObjectDefinition and Tag.
 *
 * Creating a new version of an object is very similar to creating a new object,
 * in that the entire metadata definition must be supplied. TRAC will perform
 * validation to make sure the new definition is a valid version update from the
 * previous version - the semantics of versioning depend on the particular object
 * type.
 *
 * The metadata write API also provides a means for updating tags (i.e. creating
 * a new tag version); tag updates are allowed for all object types via the public
 * API. The current API requires a whole new tag to be supplied, this will be
 * replaced in a future version with an API that supplies attributes changes as a
 * set of add/modify/remove operations.
 *
 * This API is a multi-tenant API. For gRPC requests every request includes a
 * tenant code, for REST requests the tenant code is the first element of every
 * path.
 *

 * @see Tag
